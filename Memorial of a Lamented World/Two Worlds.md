Once upon a time, there were two planets orbiting each other as if one was the moon of the other while both were orbiting the same sun. Eventually both planets developed intelligent life at the same time, as if they were synchronized.

The first planet was named [[Porcelain]] and the second planet was named [[Cerise]].
