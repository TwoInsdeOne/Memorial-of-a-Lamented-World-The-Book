*Once more the word "feel" will become overused in my writings, because there's no other way to point at that, since it's all so unclear.*

*I feel that there was a time when I lived near you, but for some reason my memories where dissolved after I was born in this world. I can't remember, but my body feels it. It's like the voice in my mind just wants to tell me the story of us, but it's not allowed to.*

*I miss you. Makes me feel so old. I feel no desire to be precise with my words. Sometimes it even feels like it's unnecessary. At the same time it feels like it's unavoidable. Everyone is on the same page as me. One day we will find you and reconnect.*
