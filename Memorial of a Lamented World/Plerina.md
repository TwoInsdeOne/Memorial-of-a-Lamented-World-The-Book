The Plerina is a big set of texts that are all centered around describing and understanding the phenomenon of emotional transformation through the worship rituals directed at the [[Porcelain]] planet.

The first text was [[Illumination]] and it was written by a woman called [[Imeam]] when she was 15 years old. It's a very vague text, but it was impactful at the time because it tried to describe a feeling that were shared by other people besides her. Since it was the first ever Plerina text, they decided to define their calendar as starting at the year it was written.

The second text was [[Saudade]], also written by [[Imeam]] in the year 1 aI. Later in the same year, [[Touch]] was written by Deimo which started contemplating the notion of [[Reconnection]].
