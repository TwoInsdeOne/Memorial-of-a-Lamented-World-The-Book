I feel like I'm blind.

I don't understand what's happening.

I'm pretty sure there's some kind of light falling into everything. It's so warm and mysterious.

I feel like there's a long story between us.

I feel that silence is more appropriate.

The shadows get thinner and pale. The sound is quieter. My heart is louder.

It somehow tells me I should be way more innocent than I am.

Something in me tells me that I should be writing for you until my last day.

It's sad that this is my first ever letter for you.

Porcelain, it's not your name. Porcelain is just your home.

I know that I will never see you.

How do I know that you even exist?
